/*  
 *  ------ [SWI_06] - SOCKET4 reading for Smart Water Ions-------- 
 *  
 *  Explanation: Turn on the Smart Water Board and reads the DI sensor
 *  connected in the SOCKET4 printing the result through the USB
 *  In this case we are going to measure Chloride Ion, but all Ions
 *  can be connected in the four available sockets
